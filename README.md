# Project Details

This project comprises several analytical tasks aimed at evaluating customer behavior, organizational diversity, call center performance, and customer risk factors. Each task was handled with Power BI to create interactive and insightful dashboards. Below is an expanded description of each task:

# Task 2: Call Center Performance Analysis

The goal of this task was to analyze customer interactions with the call center, focusing on agent performance, customer satisfaction, and resolution efficiency. Key aspects included:

Agent Satisfaction Ratings:

Measuring satisfaction across agents to understand performance and identify top-performing staff.

Call Resolution: 
Tracking the number of problems resolved daily, comparing performance across agents, and calculating the average speed of answering calls.
Unresolved Issues: Quantifying unresolved calls to highlight service bottlenecks or areas needing improvement.

This task’s insights help improve customer support by identifying patterns in agent performance and highlighting where response times or resolution rates need enhancement.

This task involved visualizing customer data to understand how different services are utilized and how service levels vary across demographics. Key areas of focus included:

Customer Contract Types: 

Visualizing contract distribution (month-to-month, one-year, two-year) and identifying which contracts are associated with higher churn.

Service Subscriptions:
Analyzing the usage rates of additional services like streaming TV, phone services, and online backups.

Billing and Payment Preferences:

Understanding customer preferences for payment methods and paperless billing to optimize payment processes and potentially reduce churn.
Insights from this task guide marketing efforts, allowing the company to target specific customer segments with tailored service offerings and contracts.

# Task 3: Churn and Risk Analysis

This task provided a comprehensive analysis of customer churn rates and identified high-risk customer segments. Highlights of the analysis include:

Churn Rate Analysis:

Calculating churn rates and breaking down churn by contract type, service usage, and customer tenure to reveal retention challenges.

Risk Categorization: 
Grouping customers into low, medium, and high-risk categories based on their likelihood to churn. High-risk customers were often on month-to-month contracts and frequently contacted support for technical or administrative issues.

Customer Demographics:

Analyzing age, gender, and tenure to understand which demographics are more likely to churn.

The task’s output helps design effective retention strategies by identifying key drivers of churn and guiding targeted retention campaigns.

# Task 4:Diversity & Inclusion Analysis

This task focused on analyzing employee demographics, promotion patterns, and performance ratings to assess diversity and inclusion within the organization.

It includes:

Gender Representation by Job Level:

Tracking the gender distribution across job levels, promotions, and turnover rates to assess if there’s fair representation and advancement.

Employee Turnover by Gender and Job Level: 

Examining turnover rates to identify where retention may be a challenge, particularly for female employees and junior officers.

Performance Ratings: Evaluating whether performance ratings are consistent across genders, ensuring unbiased evaluation practices.

The insights from this task inform the company’s diversity initiatives, helping to foster a more inclusive workplace with fair career advancement opportunities for all employees.

Visualizations

Visualizations for the above insights were created in Power BI and provide visual clarity to the patterns observed. Key visualizations include:

Customer Churn Rate by Contract Type and Service Usage Shows the correlation between contract types and churn rates, highlighting the impact of service issues on customer satisfaction.

Employee Distribution Across Job Levels by Gender
Illustrates gender representation across different organizational levels, focusing on promotion rates and turnover.

Call Center Agent Performance and Topic Analysis
Analyzes agent performance metrics and identifies call topics that require extended handling times.
